### System Stuff

This repo contains different files for my personal system (install scripts, dotfiles, etc)

Arch-btrfs: A script which will install a barebones Arch system with a BTRFS subvolume layout compatible with snapper rollback. Script is based off of TommyTran732's [Arch-Setup-Script](https://github.com/TommyTran732/Arch-Setup-Script/).
