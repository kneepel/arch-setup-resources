### Personal Arch Install Script

This is an installer for my personal system that will setup a BTRFS filesystem with full snapper rollback support (mostly) using OpenSUSE Tumbleweed's default subvolume layout. This repo is subject to massive breaking changes and is catered to my needs, as such this should not be used without being heavily reviewed and modified (if it even works!).


This script is modified from TommyTran732's [Arch-Setup-Script](https://github.com/TommyTran732/Arch-Setup-Script/) which itself is based off of [easy-arch](https://github.com/classy-giraffe/easy-arch). I recommend anyone check out these projects if they themselves want to achieve something similar.
